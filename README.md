Steps :

1. Use basic imports and read the file you want to reduce entries. 
2. Storing in a variable and checking where the data entries are required. <br>
       Eg - For this repo, like in this dataset there are 525 species of Birds, but I wanted to try for the first 5 species only. So I put check on this dataset and got only the first 5 species.. <br>
3. And then when you got the entries reduced, convert them into a new file
